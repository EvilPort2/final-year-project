# Face-Recognition
Facial Recognition using OpenCV and Python

# Algorithm I am using
The algorithm I am using to train my model is Local Binary Pattern Histogram. Many sites say that this is one of the most accurate algorithms.

# Folders
recognized = Contains the trained model<br>
dataset = Contains the photos that are used to train the model<br>
py = Contains the important python files<br>
sample pics = Contains the files that are to be used by faceDetectFromImage.py<br>

# Requirements
1. opencv-python<br>
2. opencv-contrib-python<br>
<br>These libraries can be installed using pip install command.

# Usage
    python3 faceRecognizeMain.py


# Extras that are included
A simple face detection program that can detect faces in a picture.
